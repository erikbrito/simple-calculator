Simple calculator with 2 fields and 4 operating buttons

Made with Vue.js, Vuetify and Javascript

In HTML / Vue.js, 2 fields are created to place the numbers and 4 buttons to choose the type of operation to be performed in the calculation. They are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. And, in the end, I create 1 more button to clear the fields and do a new operation.

In the script, the variables that will receive the two numbers and the one that will receive the total value to be printed on the screen are created. And right after that are the methods for each of the buttons that will be called according to the choice of the operation to be made
